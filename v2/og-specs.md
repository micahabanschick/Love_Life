# Specifications for the Rails Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y; e.g. User has_many Recipes) 
- [x] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. 
- [x] All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.
- [x] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.
- [x] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. 
- [x] Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). 
- [x] Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.
- [x] Use preventDefault to control form submit behavior

JavaScript
- [x] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
- [x] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [x] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).

Rails
- [x] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
- [x] Well-named variables and methods
- [x] Short, single-purpose methods

Git
- [x] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
- [x] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
- [x] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [x] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate
